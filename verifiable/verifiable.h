/* Routines for launching kernels that verify reduction results. A significant
 * feature of these routines is they carefully craft floating point input
 * to produce exactly predictable output.
 *
 * int elt_ty: actually just a ncclDataType_t
 *
 * int red_op: mostly just a  ncclRedOp_t. Since PreMulSum ops are dynamically
 * created, these are encoded as the value ncclNumOps and their scalar is
 * assumed to be `ncclVerifiablePremulScalar(rank_me)`
 *
 * uint64_t seed: arbitrary 64-bits to use in seeding the random values
 *
 * intptr_t elt_ix0: index of first element pointed to by elts when generating
 * random values. This makes it possible to generate subsequences independently
 * as well as in aggregate.
 *
 * int rank_n: Number of contributions into the reduction. Non-reduction
 * collectives like broadcast, gather, etc will always set this to one.
 *
 * int rank_me: Index of this contribution
